# trafficmanagementproject

This project was our final group project for a Master in Software Development with an industry partner.

I worked in a team of 5 developers, 2 UX designers and 3 Business Analysts.

Our task was to develop a Traffic Management Plan creator, aka "Site Mate" for Worksafe. This project is a prototype MVP for the organisation.

This was a 3 week project, where we learned React for the frontend, which was a challenge.

There is currently no backend due to the time constraints of having to learn the full MERN stack (within 3 weeks!)
